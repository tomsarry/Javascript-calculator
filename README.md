# Javascript-calculator
An easy javascript calculator using HTML / CSS / Javascript.

# Functionality / Details
You can input data either with buttons or the keyboard.
It currently only handles binary operations : one operand for 2 numbers, such as '+','-','*','/'.
I used Regex in order to retrieve the numbers and operator given as input.
